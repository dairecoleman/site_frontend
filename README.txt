# üå•Ô∏è Cloud Resume Challenge + Portfolio Site

This project is part of the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/), a 16-step hands-on initiative designed to bridge the gap from cloud certification to a real-world cloud/devops role. 

I've gone a bit further ‚Äî this site also serves as my personal portfolio, showcasing my **resume**, **projects**, and **passions** (like coding, game development, fitness & toast üçû).
